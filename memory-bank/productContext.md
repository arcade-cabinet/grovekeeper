# Product Context -- Grovekeeper

## Why This Exists

Grovekeeper fills a gap in the mobile gaming landscape: a genuinely cozy, non-predatory tree-planting game that respects the player's time. Most mobile games in this space are either:
- Aggressive with microtransactions and timers designed to frustrate
- Too shallow to sustain interest beyond a day
- Not actually playable in short sessions despite claiming to be

Grovekeeper is the antithesis: patient, warm, and designed for the rhythm of daily life.

## Who It's For

**Primary:** Commuters and casual mobile gamers who want 3-15 minutes of calm, rewarding gameplay.

**Secondary:** Desktop users who enjoy idle/tending games (Stardew Valley fans, terrarium enthusiasts, cozy game community).

**Persona:** Someone waiting for a bus, riding a train, or unwinding before bed. They want to check on their grove, plant a few trees, harvest what's ready, explore a new zone, and feel a small sense of accomplishment.

## Brand Essence

**Cozy, grounded, and quietly magical.**

Like tending a tiny world in a glass terrarium -- warm light through leaves, rich soil, the slow satisfaction of watching something grow.

### Brand Pillars
- **Warmth** -- Earth tones, rounded shapes, soft shadows, well-lit bark and leaves
- **Growth** -- Everything evolves; nothing stays static; smooth lerp animations show progress
- **Wonder** -- Small magical moments hidden in the ordinary (Ghost Birch night glow, Crystal Oak prismatic tints, cherry blossom petals drifting in spring, discovering new zones)
- **Patience** -- Good things take time (anti-hustle energy)

## User Experience Goals

### Emotional Journey
1. **First open:** "Oh, this is charming" -- warm colors, cute farmer mascot, inviting
2. **First plant:** "That was easy" -- clear flow, satisfying feedback
3. **First growth:** "I can't wait to see it bigger" -- anticipation hook, smooth growth animations
4. **First harvest:** "I earned this" -- tangible reward with floating resource particles
5. **Session end:** "I'll check on my grove later" -- retention pull
6. **Return visit:** "My trees grew!" -- offline growth calculation creates delight
7. **First zone transition:** "There's more to explore!" -- discovery moment
8. **Achievement unlock:** "I did something special" -- gold-border modal with sparkle effect
9. **Prestige reset:** "Starting fresh with new powers" -- cosmetic border themes and a fresh procedural world as lasting reward

### Session Design (Mobile-First)

A typical 5-minute session:
1. Load save (instant -- auto on mount, offline growth calculated)
2. See what grew while away (growth animations catch up)
3. Harvest any ready trees (quick taps, floating resource particles)
4. Plant new seeds in empty tiles
5. Water any thirsty saplings
6. Check quest progress
7. Walk to adjacent zone to check on trees there
8. Place a decorative structure or expand grid
9. Auto-save on exit (visibility change)

Everything works with one hand (thumb on joystick, index finger tapping).

### Core Game Loop

```
EXPLORE -> PLANT -> TEND -> HARVEST -> EXPAND & UNLOCK (repeat)
```

The loop feels like a garden -- not a factory. No urgency. No punishment for not playing. Trees grow while you're away. The game rewards patience, not grinding. Zone exploration adds discovery without overwhelming scope.

## How It Feels

- **Visual:** Like looking into a tiny terrarium on a desk -- warm-lit bark, rich earth, small things growing with smooth animations, new areas to discover
- **Audio (future):** Gentle ambient nature sounds, soft "pop" when trees grow, rustling leaves
- **Interaction:** Smooth, responsive, forgiving -- tapping near a tile selects it, not pixel-precision required
- **Pacing:** Calm, but not boring -- there's always something to do, but never pressure to do it NOW
- **Progression:** Steady and visible -- new species, new tools, bigger grove, new zones, prestige borders, all unlocked by just... playing
- **Weather:** Rain enhances growth, drought slows it, windstorms add tension -- but nothing punishes the player
- **Exploration:** New zones appear organically as you level, each with different biomes and layouts

## What It's NOT

- Not a clicker/idle game with exponential numbers
- Not a competitive game with leaderboards
- Not a game that punishes you for not playing
- Not a game that tries to sell you anything
- Not a desktop game crammed onto mobile -- it's mobile-first, desktop-enhanced
- Not an endless open world -- zones are small, purposeful, and curated
