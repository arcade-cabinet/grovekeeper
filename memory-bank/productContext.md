# Product Context — Grovekeeper

## Why This Exists

Grovekeeper fills a gap in the mobile gaming landscape: a genuinely cozy, non-predatory tree-planting game that respects the player's time. Most mobile games in this space are either:
- Aggressive with microtransactions and timers designed to frustrate
- Too shallow to sustain interest beyond a day
- Not actually playable in short sessions despite claiming to be

Grovekeeper is the antithesis: patient, warm, and designed for the rhythm of daily life.

## Who It's For

**Primary:** Commuters and casual mobile gamers who want 3-15 minutes of calm, rewarding gameplay.

**Secondary:** Desktop users who enjoy idle/tending games (Stardew Valley fans, terrarium enthusiasts, cozy game community).

**Persona:** Someone waiting for a bus, riding a train, or unwinding before bed. They want to check on their grove, plant a few trees, harvest what's ready, and feel a small sense of accomplishment.

## Brand Essence

**Cozy, grounded, and quietly magical.**

Like tending a tiny world in a glass terrarium — warm light through leaves, rich soil, the slow satisfaction of watching something grow.

### Brand Pillars
- **Warmth** — Earth tones, rounded shapes, soft shadows
- **Growth** — Everything evolves; nothing stays static
- **Wonder** — Small magical moments hidden in the ordinary
- **Patience** — Good things take time (anti-hustle energy)

## User Experience Goals

### Emotional Journey
1. **First open:** "Oh, this is charming" — warm colors, cute farmer mascot, inviting
2. **First plant:** "That was easy" — clear flow, satisfying feedback
3. **First growth:** "I can't wait to see it bigger" — anticipation hook
4. **First harvest:** "I earned this" — tangible reward
5. **Session end:** "I'll check on my grove later" — retention pull
6. **Return visit:** "My trees grew!" — offline progress creates delight

### Session Design (Mobile-First)

A typical 5-minute session:
1. Load save (instant — auto on mount)
2. See what grew while away (offline growth calculation)
3. Harvest any ready trees (quick taps)
4. Plant new seeds in empty tiles
5. Water any thirsty saplings
6. Check daily challenge progress
7. Auto-save on exit (visibility change)

Everything must work with one hand (thumb on joystick, index finger tapping).

### Core Game Loop

```
EXPLORE → PLANT → TEND → HARVEST → EXPAND & UNLOCK (repeat)
```

The loop should feel like a garden — not a factory. No urgency. No punishment for not playing. Trees grow while you're away. The game rewards patience, not grinding.

## How It Should Feel

- **Visual:** Like looking into a tiny terrarium on a desk — warm light, rich earth, small things growing
- **Audio (future):** Gentle ambient nature sounds, soft "pop" when trees grow, rustling leaves
- **Interaction:** Smooth, responsive, forgiving — tapping near a tile selects it, not pixel-precision required
- **Pacing:** Calm, but not boring — there's always something to do, but never pressure to do it NOW
- **Progression:** Steady and visible — new species, new tools, bigger grove, all unlocked by just... playing

## What It's NOT

- Not a clicker/idle game with exponential numbers
- Not a competitive game with leaderboards (at launch)
- Not a game that punishes you for not playing
- Not a game that tries to sell you anything
- Not a desktop game crammed onto mobile — it's mobile-first, desktop-enhanced
