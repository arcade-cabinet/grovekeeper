# Ralph Progress Log

This file tracks progress across iterations. Agents update this file
after each iteration and it's included in prompts for context.

## Codebase Patterns (Study These First)

- **WalkabilityCell mapping pattern**: When removing GridCellComponent from a call site that passes `gridCellsQuery` to `buildWalkabilityGrid`, map inline: `walkCells.push({ x: gridX, z: gridZ, walkable: type === "soil" || type === "path" })` before calling `buildWalkabilityGrid(walkCells, bounds)`.
- **Chunk-based tile state**: `occupied` = `!!tree || !!rock` via ECS queries; `cellType` = `rock ? "rock" : "soil"`. No GridCellComponent needed — derive from entity presence at position.
- **Decoupling system inputs**: Replace `GridCellComponent`-shaped params with a minimal local interface (e.g., `WalkabilityCell`) so systems don't import ECS component types.

## 2026-03-07 - US-001
- Removed all `GridCellComponent` imports and usage from `game/systems/` and `game/hooks/`
- **Files changed:**
  - `game/systems/pathfinding.ts`: removed `GridCellComponent` import, introduced local `WalkabilityCell` interface (`{ x, z, walkable }`) replacing the old `{ gridCell?: GridCellComponent }` param shape
  - `game/hooks/useInteraction.ts`: removed `GridCellComponent` type import and `gridCellsQuery`; replaced `findGridCell` with `findRockAtGrid` using `rocksQuery`; updated `buildTileState` to derive `occupied`/`cellType` from tree+rock entity presence
  - `game/systems/pathfinding.test.ts`: migrated all `buildWalkabilityGrid` test fixtures from `{ gridCell: {...} }` shape to `WalkabilityCell` format
  - `game/hooks/useGameLoop.ts`: mapped `gridCellsQuery` to `WalkabilityCell[]` before calling `buildWalkabilityGrid`
  - `game/ai/PlayerGovernor.ts`: same mapping at call site (file is in `game/ai/`, outside acceptance criteria dirs, but needed for tsc)
- **Learnings:**
  - The grep acceptance criteria only check for the string `GridCellComponent` by name — implicit `gridCell` field access (e.g., `cell.gridCell.gridX`) doesn't trigger it, but still causes tsc errors at call sites with mismatched types
  - When a system function's input type changes, ALL callers must be updated for tsc to pass, even if those callers are outside the acceptance criteria directories
  - `ChunkComponent` (`chunkX`, `chunkZ`, `biome`) operates at chunk granularity — it can't replace per-tile `GridCellComponent` data directly; tile-level state must be inferred from other ECS entities (rocks, trees) at that position
